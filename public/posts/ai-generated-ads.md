title: AI generated ads and privacy
date: "2020-01-02"
summary:
  AI generated ads will offer us the capability of connecting with each customer
  personally, but this may come at a great cost for privacy
---

We divide customers into cohorts in order to find the most relevant ads for
them. This helps with ensuring that the eyeballs only touch ads that may be - at
least somewhat - related to what they want.

AI generated ads will have the capacity to adapt to the customer's current
state, needs, inner world and more. But this also means that the companies that
produce or use these ads will be exposing much more of what they know about us
by crafting these images and messages that interface much more deeply with our
emotional world.

I can imagine that there will be a backlash to this. But I cannot predict how
strong it may end up being.
