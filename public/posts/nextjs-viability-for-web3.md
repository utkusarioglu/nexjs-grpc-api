title: Viability of using NextJS in Web3 websites
date: "2020-01-01"
summary:
  NextJS has made a name for itself by using React as a primitive. But, does
  this approach also work on web3?
---

There seems to be a rising star among web frameworks. NextJS has created a name
for itself in the very competitive arena of web gui libraries by using
Facebook's React as a primitive for server-side rendering.

However, the story of server-side for web3 applications is somewhat of a
contentious issue. Ignoring the fact that Next runs on JS, any kind of
chain-side rendering for web3 application is out of the question for today
because of the nightmarish costs associated with any kind of data handling in
today's blockchain environments.

It's of course possible to serve a web3 website from a web2 backend. However,
this can be a hard-sell to web3 purists that want none of their data to be
served to any company on a silver platter.
